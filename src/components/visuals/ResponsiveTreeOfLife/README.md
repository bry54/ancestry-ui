# Responsive Tree of Life

This component renders a responsive, interactive "Tree of Life" visualization using a radial cluster layout. It is designed to display large, deeply nested hierarchies in a compact circular format.

## How to Use

### 1. Prepare Your Data

This component requires data in the **Newick format**, which is a standard for representing phylogenetic trees. The component expects a `data` prop that is the *parsed* result of a Newick string.

A parser function, `parseNewick`, is provided alongside the component to convert the string into the required hierarchical object.

```tsx
import { ResponsiveTreeOfLife } from '@/components/visuals/ResponsiveTreeOfLife/ResponsiveTreeOfLife';
import { newickSample, parseNewick } from '@/components/visuals/ResponsiveTreeOfLife/data';

// 1. Your data in Newick format as a string
const newickString = `(A,(B,C));`;

// 2. Parse the string into a hierarchical object
const parsedData = parseNewick(newickString);

const MyPage = () => (
  <div className="w-full h-[800px]">
    <ResponsiveTreeOfLife data={parsedData} />
  </div>
);
```

### 2. Place in a Container

Wrap the component in a container `<div>`. The chart will automatically resize. For best results, use a large, square container (`aspect-square`) to accommodate the radial layout.

## Interactivity

-   **Mouse Over a Node:** Highlights the node and its entire path back to the root in red.
-   **Mouse Leave the SVG:** Resets the view, removing all highlighting.

## Props

-   **`data`**: `NewickNode` (required)
    -   A nested object representing the root of the hierarchy, generated by the `parseNewick` function.
    -   `NewickNode` interface: `{ name: string; length?: number; children?: NewickNode[]; }`
