# Responsive Sequences Sunburst

This component renders a responsive and interactive "Sequences Sunburst" visualization. It is designed to show the flow of users through a sequence of events (e.g., pages on a website) and the relative proportion of each path.

This component consists of three parts:
1.  **A Breadcrumb Trail:** Shows the current path as you mouse over the chart.
2.  **A Sunburst Chart:** Visualizes the hierarchy of sequences.
3.  **A Central Text Display:** Shows the value and percentage of the highlighted path.

## How to Use

### 1. Prepare Your Data

This component requires a specific data transformation. The raw data should be an array of sequences, where each item is `[string[], number]`.

-   `string[]`: An array of strings representing the steps in a sequence.
-   `number`: The total value or count for that sequence.

Use the `buildHierarchy` utility function to convert this raw data into the nested structure the component needs.

```tsx
import { ResponsiveSequenceSunburst } from '@/components/visuals/ResponsiveSequenceSunburst/ResponsiveSequenceSunburst';
import { visitSequences, buildHierarchy } from '@/components/visuals/ResponsiveSequenceSunburst/data';

// 1. Your raw sequence data
const rawData = [
  [['home', 'about'], 100],
  [['home', 'contact'], 50],
];

// 2. Build the hierarchy
const hierarchicalData = buildHierarchy(rawData);

const MyPage = () => (
  <div className="w-full h-[700px]">
    <ResponsiveSequenceSunburst data={hierarchicalData} />
  </div>
);
```

### 2. Place in a Container

Wrap the component in a container `<div>`. The chart will automatically resize. A tall, squarish container is recommended to provide enough space for the chart and the breadcrumb trail.

## Interactivity

-   **Mouse Over an Arc:** Highlights the path in the sunburst, updates the breadcrumb trail, and shows the path's value and percentage in the center.
-   **Mouse Leave:** Resets the breadcrumb and shows the total value for the entire dataset.

## Props

-   **`data`**: `HierarchyNode` (required)
    -   A nested object representing the root of the hierarchy, typically generated by the `buildHierarchy` function.
    -   `HierarchyNode` interface: `{ name: string; value?: number; children?: HierarchyNode[]; }`
